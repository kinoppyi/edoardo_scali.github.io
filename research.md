My academic research primarily focuses on forest pathology, a branch of plant pathology that studies diseases affecting forests and tree species. The main pathogens I investigate are fungi.

As a PhD Student, I am examining the interactions between hosts and pathogens, specifically within the Cypress Canker Disease pathosystem. I conduct Dual-RNA sequencing experiments to identify the genes involved in the response to infection and to observe the effects of different climatic regimes on inoculated plants. This aspect is particularly important for understanding how cypress trees respond to diseases in the context of climate change.

My Research Interests
======
**Forest Pathology**: Forests are vital ecosystems increasingly at risk from various factors. Climate change and the rampant international trade that facilitates the movement of alien organisms exert significant pressure on forest health. Consequently, forests are becoming more susceptible to attacks from pathogenic microorganisms.

**Host-Pathogen Interaction**: I study what happen durning different steps of the infection proces by applying dual-RNA seq. When plant and pathogen interact with each other, there are many condition that can influence the outcome of an infection. I am dedicated to understanding these processes by studying the [Cypress Cancker Disease](https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/diseases/cypress-canker) pathosystem. 

**Fungal Genomics**: Understanding how fungi evolve and cause disease is a key aspect of the genomic analyses I conduct. Fungi are ideal organisms for these types of studies beacuse they have a comparatively small genome. Their genomes have been increasingly studied in recent years, revealing many secrets that make them highly intriguing organisms.

**Evolution and Coevolution**: One of the most interesting questions in biology is understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that lead certain organisms to become pathogens. This topic expands further when we consider the reciprocal influence that pathogens and hosts exert on each other's populations.

**Computational Biology**: I am a data analyses enthusiast. Since I took my first course on Statistics, I never stopped coding! I have grown my skills over time and keep learning new computational methods as a passion. I mainly work with [Savio](https://research-it.berkeley.edu/services-projects/high-performance-computing-savio) which is the UC Berkeley compuational cluster.
