My academic research primarily focuses on forest pathology, a branch of plant pathology that studies diseases affecting forests and tree species. The main pathogens I investigate are fungi.

As a PhD Student, I am examining the interactions between hosts and pathogens, specifically within the Cypress Canker Disease pathosystem. I conduct Dual-RNA sequencing experiments to identify the genes involved in the response to infection and to observe the effects of different climatic regimes on inoculated plants. This aspect is particularly important for understanding how cypress trees respond to diseases in the context of climate change.

## My Research Interests

**Forest Pathology**: Forests are vital ecosystems increasingly at risk from various factors. Climate change and the rampant international trade that facilitates the movement of alien organisms exert significant pressure on forest health. Consequently, forests are becoming more susceptible to attacks from pathogenic microorganisms.

**Host-Pathogen Interaction**: I study what happens during different steps of the infection process by applying dual-RNA seq. When plants and pathogens interact with each other, many conditions can influence the outcome of an infection. I am dedicated to understanding these processes by studying the [Cypress Canker Disease](https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/diseases/cypress-canker) pathosystem.

**Fungal Genomics**: Understanding how fungi evolve and cause disease is a key aspect of the genomic analyses I conduct. Fungi are ideal organisms for these types of studies because they have comparatively small genomes. Their genomes have been increasingly studied in recent years, revealing many secrets that make them highly intriguing organisms.

**Evolution and Coevolution**: One of the most interesting questions in biology is understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that lead certain organisms to become pathogens. This topic expands further when we consider the reciprocal influence that pathogens and hosts exert on each other's populations.

**Computational Biology**: I am a data analysis enthusiast. Since I took my first course on Statistics, I have never stopped coding! I have grown my skills over time and keep learning new computational methods as a passion. I mainly work with [Savio](https://research-it.berkeley.edu/services-projects/high-performance-computing-savio), which is the UC Berkeley computational cluster.

# My PhD Project
_My doctoral research focuses on understanding the coevolutionary relationship between Seiridium cardinale and Cupressus sempervirens, the genes involved in cypress resistance to Cypress Canker Disease (CCD), and the effect of climate on gene expression during infection._

### Comparative Genomics
To assess the evolutionary relationship between Seiridium species, I am conducting a comparative genomics study. This analysis will help identify the genomic features that make Seiridium a lethal pathogen worldwide and explain why S. cardinale became a successful pathogen in the Mediterranean Basin.

### Host-Pathogen Interaction
I apply Dual-RNA sequencing to study host-pathogen interactions. This involves inoculating cypress plants with Seiridium cardinale and extracting total RNA from infected tissues. The goal is to characterize the molecular pathways activated in resistant versus susceptible cypress clones post-infection.

### Climate Change Effects
To understand the impact of climate change on the CCD pathosystem, I leverage California’s diverse climates. I placed sets of cypress plants in three locations:

- Coastal Area: Mediterranean climate with fog (18°C / 11°C)
- Bay Area: Mediterranean climate with cool summer (22°C / 12°C)
- Inland California: Mediterranean climate with hot summer (34°C / 14°C)

Plants are inoculated, and total RNA is extracted from symptomatic tissues to identify genes involved in the infection under different climatic conditions. This research aims to predict the impact of climate change on cypress trees.
