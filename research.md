_My academic research focusses on the understanding of plant diseases affecting forests and trees. The main pathogens I investigate are fungi._

As a PhD Student, I am examining the interactions between hosts and pathogens, specifically within the Cypress Canker Disease pathosystem. I conduct Dual-RNA sequencing experiments to identify the genes involved in the response to infection and to observe the effects of different climates on infected plants. This aspect is particularly important for understanding how trees respond to diseases in the context of [climate breakdown](https://www.act.nato.int/article/climate-breakdown-and-the-loss-of-biodiversity/#:~:text=Rising%20global%20temperatures%2C%20driven%20by,vital%20ecosystems%20face%20heightened%20risks.).

## My Research Interests

**Forest Pathology**: Forests are vital ecosystems and are constatly pressured by human activityes and changing climates. With my research, I want to undesrstand what is the role of pathigen in this challenging scenario. Climate breakdown and the rampant international trade that facilitates the movement of alien organisms exerting significant pressure on forest health. Consequently, forests are becoming more susceptible to attacks from pathogenic microorganisms.

**Host-Pathogen Interaction**: I study what happens during the plant infection by applying dual-RNA seq. When plants and pathogens interact with each other, many factors can influence the outcome of the disease. With my research, I want to understand these processes in the Cypress Canker Disease pathosystem, characterizing the gene expression of resistant and susceptible plants. 

**Fungal Genomics**: Understanding how fungi cause disease is a key aspect of the genomic analyses I conduct in the context of plant pathology. Fungal genomiucs is a vibrant research topic within which it is possible to answer many questions of biological interest and reveal the secrets of these wonderful organisms. 

**Evolution and Coevolution**: One of the most interesting questions in biology consists in the understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms that lead certain organisms to become pathogens. When this aspect is further expanded, and we consider the reciprocal influence that pathogens and hosts exert on each other's populations, it allows to answer key question in the context of host-pathogen interaction. These answers provide key knowledge for a succesfull disease management. 

**Computational Biology**: I am a data analysis enthusiast. Since I took my first course on Statistics, I have never stopped coding! I have grown my skills over time and keep learning new computational methods as a passion. I mainly work with [Savio](https://research-it.berkeley.edu/services-projects/high-performance-computing-savio), which is the UC Berkeley computational cluster. 

# My PhD Project
_My doctoral research focuses on understanding the host-pathogen interaction between Seiridium cardinale and Cupressus sempervirens. What are the genes involved in cypress resistance to Cypress Canker Disease (CCD)? How the effect of climate on gene expression during infection? These are some of the questions I try to answer._

### Comparative Genomics
To assess the evolutionary relationship between Seiridium species, I am conducting a comparative genomics study. This analysis will help identify the genomic features that make Seiridium a lethal pathogen worldwide and explain why S. cardinale became a successful pathogen in the Mediterranean Basin.

### Host-Pathogen Interaction
I apply Dual-RNA sequencing to study host-pathogen interactions. This involves inoculating cypress plants with Seiridium cardinale and extracting total RNA from infected tissues. The goal is to characterize the molecular pathways activated in resistant versus susceptible cypress clones post-infection.

### Climate Effects
To understand the impact of climate breakdown on the CCD pathosystem, I leverage California’s diverse climates. I placed sets of cypress plants in three locations:

- Coastal Area: Mediterranean climate with fog (18°C / 11°C)
- Bay Area: Mediterranean climate with cool summer (22°C / 12°C)
- Inland California: Mediterranean climate with hot summer (34°C / 14°C)

Plants are inoculated, and total RNA is extracted from symptomatic tissues to identify genes involved in the infection under different climatic conditions. This research aims to predict the impact of climate on cypress trees.
