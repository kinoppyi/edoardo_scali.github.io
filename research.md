My academic research primarily focuses on forest pathology, a branch of plant pathology that studies diseases affecting forests and tree species. The main pathogens I investigate are fungi.

As a PhD Student, I am examining the interactions between hosts and pathogens, specifically within the Cypress Canker Disease pathosystem. I conduct Dual-RNA sequencing experiments to identify the genes involved in the response to infection and to observe the effects of different climatic regimes on inoculated plants. This aspect is particularly important for understanding how cypress trees respond to diseases in the context of climate change.
