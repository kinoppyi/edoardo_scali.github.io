I am a PhD student at the [Environemntal Sciencie Policy & Management Department](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/) of the University of California, Berkeley and I am a Graduate Student at [Garbelotto's Lab](https://nature.berkeley.edu/matteolab/?page_id=12). I started my experience as a PhD in the Fall of 2022 as a Fulbright Scholar. 

My Research Interests
======
**Forest Pathology**: Forests are vital ecosystems increasingly at risk from various factors. Climate change and the rampant international trade that facilitates the movement of alien organisms exert significant pressure on forest health. Consequently, forests are becoming more susceptible to attacks from pathogenic microorganisms.

**Host-Pathogen Interaction**: I study what happen durning different steps of the infection proces by applying dual-RNA seq. When plant and pathogen interact with each other, there are many condition that can influence the outcome of an infection. I am dedicated to understanding these processes by studying the [Cypress Cancker Disease](https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/diseases/cypress-canker) pathosystem. 

**Fungal Genomics**: Understanding how fungi evolve and cause disease is a key aspect of the genomic analyses I conduct. Fungi are ideal organisms for these types of studies beacuse they have a comparatively small genome. Their genomes have been increasingly studied in recent years, revealing many secrets that make them highly intriguing organisms.

**Evolution and Coevolution**: One of the most interesting questions in biology is understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that lead certain organisms to become pathogens. This topic expands further when we consider the reciprocal influence that pathogens and hosts exert on each other's populations.

**Computational Biology**: I am a data analyses enthusiast. Since I took my first course on Statistics, I never stopped coding! I have grown my skills over time and keep learning new computational methods as a passion. I mainly work with [Savio](https://research-it.berkeley.edu/services-projects/high-performance-computing-savio) which is the UC Berkeley compuational cluster.

My Previous Experience
======
Before embarking on this PhD, I worked for about a year as a research fellow in a joint supervision between the University of Florence and the Italian National Research Council in Sesto Fiorentino. However, one of the most formative professional experiences I've had was working in migrant reception centers in Italy for two and a half years. This experience greatly enriched me on a personal level and allowed me to view my current scientific work from a different perspective. I am particularly sensitive to the impact of forest loss on the populations living in surrounding areas. Additionally, I am deeply interested in the application of plant pathology to food security.
